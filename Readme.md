# Snapshot Testing in iOS â€“ Demo Project

This repository contains the demo project for my article:  
[Snapshot Testing in iOS: How to TDD Your UI and Avoid Visual Bugs](https://esmuil.medium.com/snapshot-testing-in-ios-how-to-tdd-your-ui-and-avoid-visual-bugs-520dddb60879) on Medium.

The article explains how snapshot testing helps you catch visual regressions automatically and keep your UI consistent across devices, themes, and orientations. Instead of manually checking your views in the simulator, you write tests that compare your UI against baseline images. This way, design changes are intentional, and bugs are spotted immediately.
